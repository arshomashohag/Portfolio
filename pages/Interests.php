      <h2>Programming</h2>
 	  <p>
 	  	Before my university admission I barely know about programming or programming languages. Even, I had no PC. After getting myself admitted to CSE of RU I came to know about computer programming programming languages.Among hundreds of programming languages I love C++ most though C is the first language I learned. From the very beginngin of my university study I love programming very much.   
 	  </p>
 	  <br>
 	 <h2>Solving Problems</h2>
 	  <p>
 	  	   Real life proglem solving doing computer programming is another favourite things I do . After learning C I started competitive program solving . 
 	  </p>

 	  <h2>Attending Competitive Programming Contests</h2>
 	  <p>
 	  	   As I said, I love problem solving and competitive programming contests are the platform to judge our progress. So I attended some contests and love to attend anytime.
 	  </p>

 	  <h2>Learning New Things</h2>
 	  <p>
 	  	 Learning new things is always fun to me and I love to learn trics and funny things of math, physics etc.
